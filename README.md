# LoRA
 A detailed Tutorial showing the process of fine-tuning a causal language model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). 

## **Fine-Tuning a Llama Model for Chat Interactions with LoRA**

This tutorial demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained Llama language model for chat-based interactions. We leverage the Guanaco dataset, designed for instruction tuning, and employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning. LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters, making the process faster and less resource-intensive.

### **Key Steps**

1. **Setup:**
   - Install required libraries: `transformers`, `datasets`, `evaluate`, `peft`, `trl`, and `bitsandbytes`.
   - Import necessary modules from these libraries.
   - Define the paths to the base model, dataset, and the name for the new fine-tuned model.

2. **Load Model and Dataset:**
   - Load the pre-trained Llama model using `AutoModelForCausalLM`, utilizing available devices for efficient computation.
   - Load the Guanaco dataset, which contains conversational data for instruction tuning.
   - Load the tokenizer associated with the pre-trained model and set appropriate padding configurations.

3. **Pre-Fine-Tuning Inference (Optional):**
   - Create a simple text generation pipeline using the pre-trained model and tokenizer.
   - Run inference with a sample prompt to see the model's baseline performance before fine-tuning.

4. **Configure LoRA and Training:**
   - Define LoRA parameters (e.g., `lora_alpha`, `lora_dropout`, `r`) for efficient fine-tuning.
   - Set up training parameters (e.g., `num_train_epochs`, `per_device_train_batch_size`, `learning_rate`).
   - Create an `SFTTrainer` instance, combining the model, dataset, LoRA configuration, tokenizer, and training parameters.

5. **Fine-Tune the Model:**
   - Initiate training by calling `trainer.train()`. The model will learn to generate responses that are more aligned with the conversational style and instructions in the Guanaco dataset.
   - Monitor the training progress, including loss and other metrics.

6. **Save the Fine-Tuned Model:**
   - After training, save the fine-tuned model and tokenizer to a specified directory (`new_model`).

7. **Post-Fine-Tuning Inference:**
   - Create another text generation pipeline using the fine-tuned model.
   - Run inference again with the same sample prompt to compare the model's responses before and after fine-tuning. You should observe improvements in the quality and relevance of the generated text.

### **Important Considerations**

* **Hardware Requirements:** Fine-tuning large language models can be computationally intensive. Ensure you have sufficient GPU memory and processing power.
* **Dataset Quality:** The quality of the fine-tuning dataset (Guanaco in this case) significantly impacts the performance of the final model. 
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different LoRA and training parameters to optimize the fine-tuning process and achieve the best results.
